# Who

I'm a data programmer.

# What

This is a blog about my interests: Data, programming, politics, social science, books, video games, whatever.

Everything is political, and my writing acknowledges this. I live in New Jersey, so I tend to zoom in on issues here and, of course, as a classic suburban busybody, in Philly and NYC.

Everyone and every thing you read is biased. There's no such thing as an unbiased perspective. I don't try to hide my bias.

# How

For anyone interested, I built this website with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) because I want to include interactive data visualizations and code output in my posts. I code in R and Python, but I'll check out other languages.

For data visualization, I usually use [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for static charts and maps, [Plotly](https://plotly.com/ggplot2/) for interactive charts, [tmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html) (and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)) for interactive maps, and [React Table](https://github.com/tanstack/table/tree/v7) for interactive tables.
