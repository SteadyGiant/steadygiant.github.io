This is a blog about my interests. I live in New Jersey, so I tend to zoom in on issues around here.

For anyone interested, I built this website with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) because I want to include *interactive* graphics and other output from *multiple programming languages* in my posts. I mostly use R and Python, but I'll check out others.

For data visualization, I usually use [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for static charts and maps, [Plotly](https://plotly.com/ggplot2/) for interactive charts, [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for interactive maps, and [React Table](https://github.com/tanstack/table/tree/v7) for interactive tables.
