<td><em>If you live anywhere in New Jersey, consider signing <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/dont-widen-the-nj-turnpike-in-south-jersey/"><strong>this petition</strong></a> against the proposed widening of the NJ Turnpike in South Jersey. Widening roads doesn’t cure congestion; it just gets more cars on the road. That’s more emissions, more sprawl, more truck-served warehouses, and more motor vehicle fatalities.</em></td>

<p>You may have read that motor vehicle fatalities in New Jersey <a href="https://www.nj.com/news/2023/01/traffic-deaths-on-nj-roads-reach-a-15-year-high.html?outputType=amp">are rising</a> and cops <a href="https://www.nj.com/news/2023/03/as-traffic-deaths-continue-to-rise-in-nj-fewer-tickets-are-being-written.html?outputType=amp">aren’t issuing enough</a> traffic tickets. This got me thinking, which parts of NJ are affected the most?</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://www.nj.com/news/g66l-2019/01/16aa4762ac1143/the-deadliest-nj-counties-for-traffic-accidents-ranked-from-least-to-most.html?outputType=amp">this 2019 article on NJ.com</a>: “The deadliest N.J. counties for traffic crashes, ranked from least to most.” The problem is that more populous counties have more motor vehicle fatalities in part because they simply have more people traveling around.</p>
<p>I’m more interested in fatality <em>rates</em>, fatalities as a proportion of vehicle miles traveled. This gets us closer to answering the question: If you’re traveling in X County, what’s the chance that you’ll die—or kill—in traffic?</p>
<p>So I grabbed the <a href="https://www.nj.gov/njsp/info/fatalacc/2022-stats.shtml">latest traffic fatalities report</a> from the NJ State Police and <a href="https://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/roadway/vmt.shtm">daily average vehicle miles traveled</a> from NJDOT. This includes <em>all</em> road users: Drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and cyclists.</p>
<p>And here they are, the deadliest counties:</p>

<p>Traffic fatalities occur most often in South Jersey and some of North Jersey’s more rural or exurban counties. It’s not because we drive way more than other counties; sorting by VMT shows Central and less remote North Jersey counties generally drive much more. Salem County drives the fewest miles but fatalities occur most often there.</p>
<p>It turns out car-dependence isn’t working out well for us. But rural life doesn’t need to mean more driving and danger. Even rural communities can be walkable and not car-centric! See Alan Fisher’s video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9KNax1QpD4">Hawley, Pennsylvania</a>. Hunterdon County is the 2nd least deadly, proving the rest of rural Jersey can do better.</p>
<p>But it’s not all dandy up north. Essex County stands out among its neighbors. Hudson, despite being our most urbanized county, has nowhere near the lowest traffic fatality rate.</p>
<section id="what-to-do-about-it" class="level1">
<h1>What to do about it</h1>
<p>There are tons of improvements that will make our roads safer. Our goals should include calming traffic; making all roads accessible and safe for <em>all</em> users, not just drivers; providing reliable, convenient alternatives to driving; and increasing trips taken without cars. Here are some videos that impressed me recently:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ByEBjf9ktY">“Crossing the Street Shouldn’t Be Deadly (but it is),”</a> by Not Just Bikes - Lists tons of specific road safety improvements your town needs like continuous sidewalks, raised intersections, and elimination of slip lanes.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ0pnCx76Nk">“Roundabouts vs Traffic Lights,”</a> by John Stossel - Shows how roundabouts are a safer, cheaper, more efficient alternative to traffic lights.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42oQN7fy_eM">“Stop SIgns Suck and We Should Get Rid of Them,”</a> by Not Just Bikes - How about actually making drivers stop?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all great, but we must make our governments actually do this stuff. Let’s say you know a street, road, or stroad near you needing improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Figure out which government is responsible for it. Is it a municipal, county, state, or Federal road? My borough has them all, and they all suck.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Complain. Use your speaking-to-the-manager skills for good. Go to a town/city/township/borough/county council/commission meeting and ask them for bike lanes—protected by physical barriers like <a href="https://marvel-b1-cdn.bc0a.com/f00000000266812/www.pexco.com/assets/images/content/bikes_lanes_slider.jpg">bollards</a>—and traffic-calming features like <a href="https://nacto.org/publication/urban-street-design-guide/intersections/minor-intersections/raised-intersections/">raised intersections</a>, <a href="https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/ped_bike/step/docs/TechSheet_RaisedCW_508compliant.pdf">raised crosswalks</a>, and <a href="https://wtop.com/dc/2021/12/dc-lawmakers-want-transform-crosswalks-to-improve-pedestrian-safety/">continuous sidewalks</a>. If it’s a state road, NJDOT won’t take your complaint directly; you must convince your local government to complain to NJDOT. If it’s a Federal road, I don’t know what to do, but try asking your local council.</p>
<p>You’d be surprised how receptive local politicians can be to someone who bothers to show up to a council meeting. Just don’t be too jerky. That said, they can also give you kind words with no action. Follow up with specific requests for Feature X at Intersection Y. Ask for updates.</p>
<p>Look out for <a href="https://twitter.com/Ollie_Cycles/status/1639041285540462594">“orange-washing,”</a> where governments pretend to make roads safer. Even if your town adopts a Complete Streets plan, changes a street to match that plan, and <em>wins awards</em> for the redesign from Serious Professional Organizations, the street can still suck. See <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2023/4/10/award-winning-complete-street-just-another-deadly-stroad">Strong Towns’ analysis</a> of Ager Road in Hyattsville, Maryland.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Organize. If there are any local environmentalist groups in your area, reach out to them and talk about reducing your town’s car-dependence. Beyond that, I’m not very qualified to speak on organizing. But I’m still organizing in real life and so can you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: If there are no other ideas or you’re kind of isolated, try an educational petition. Local news is dying, and what’s left is usually very pro-car. If your petition tells the story of how your roads got so bad and how nothing is being done to fix them, you’re giving people in your community a fresh perspective and a specific action thing to do about it. You may be surprised by the responses. See my petition linked at the top for an example, or <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/safe-streets-for-glassboro">this one</a> I wrote for safer streets in Glassboro.</p>

<p>The results are mostly the same. Salem County is the deadliest. South Jersey is deadlier than North Jersey—even more so, by this measure.</p>

<p>From 2016 to 2021, NJ.com published a series of articles:</p>

</ul>
<p>To this day, these articles get cited by <a href="https://www.nj.com/opinion/2022/02/nj-transit-needs-stable-funding-so-our-future-will-be-electric-and-equitable-opinion.html?outputType=amp">local</a> and <a href="https://prospect.org/infrastructure/transportation/climate-change-and-turnpike-in-new-jersey/">national</a> media and politicians.</p>
<p>These articles are also very bad. A big, statewide transit agency like NJ Transit will always break down more times than the Port Authority of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jfefls8Qos">Nowhere, Kansas</a>.</p>
<p>Consider the MTA’s Long Island Rail Road (LIRR). In 2021, they <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2021-breakdowns">reported</a> 78 breakdowns, while the Minneapolis METRO had 2. Is the LIRR worse than METRO? Well, LIRR is the largest commuter rail system in the country by miles traveled, driving almost 368 times more miles than METRO. It’s meaningless to compare their total breakdowns, and misleading to call one worse for it. This could be a textbook example of how to lie with statistics.</p>
<p>Instead, we should compare breakdown <em>frequency</em>. <a href="https://www.njtransit.com/improve/on-time-performance/rail">Transit agencies</a> often track this as Mean Distance Between Failures, or <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7BVehicle%20And%20Passenger%20Car%20Revenue%20Miles%7D%7BBreakdowns%7D">. This tells us how many miles an agency’s trains or buses travel, on average, before breaking down. The higher the better.</p>

<p>Now we see the LIRR breaks down less <em>often</em> than METRO, despite breaking down more <em>times</em>. LIRR trains travel over 748,000 miles before breaking down, on average, while METRO trains manage just over 79,000. LIRR is both much bigger than METRO and way more reliable.</p>
<p>Take it from a more reputable news source like… NJ.com. The same author<sup>1</sup> of the above articles wrote <a href="https://www.nj.com/news/g66l-2019/01/b68e7cecf93393/nj-transit-just-hired-a-boss-f.html">this one</a> comparing NJ Transit and LIRR’s Mean Distance Between Breakdowns, not their total breakdowns.</p>
<p>Thankfully, NJ.com isn’t publishing more of these bad articles.<sup>2</sup> Even more fortunately, the NJ Democrats, who hold a trifecta, <a href="https://www.nj.com/opinion/2019/10/sweeney-no-more-excuses-its-time-to-fix-nj-transit.html">seem to</a> correctly believe that years of under-funding caused NJ Transit’s issues, and that the solution is full, stable funding.<sup>3</sup> Then again, their leader got <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2021/11/10/sweeney-concedes-stunning-loss-to-republican-durr/">ousted</a> and they’re <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/12/11/new-jersey-bail-system-roll-back-00072781">sliiiiiding to the right</a> on other issues.</p>
<p>But a problem lurks. Imagine a future where we fully fund NJ Transit. It’d be easy for a reactionary shithead to convince people that NJ Transit remains the Worst In The Nation despite all the money we pumped into it. They’d seem legit because NJ.com did the same analysis for years. Don’t lend credibility to austerity boosters by sanitizing bad analysis in our state’s Paper of Record.</p>

<p>But all of a sudden, right at the [edge] of the [Hudson], Puff! Chug! Squeak! Squea-ea-eak! The Engine broke down; the wheels slid along a little farther with a shrieking, wailing cry and then stood perfectly still. Now how was the train to cross the [Hudson] and get her [commuters] over there in time for the [work day]?</p>

<p>In this post, I rank transit agencies by their breakdown frequency, or <em>Mean Distance Between Breakdowns</em><sup>1</sup>. This metric answers the question: How many miles do the trains/buses travel before breaking down, on average? The higher, the better. My data source is the FTA’s <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2021-breakdowns">National Transit Database</a> for <strong>2021</strong>. I cover my methodology in more detail <a href="https://glassbro.blog/ntd-2021">elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p>I pay special attention to transit agencies operating in New Jersey and nearby like NJ Transit PATH, PATCO, and the MTA because I’ve ridden with them.</p>
<p>I only rank agencies in the transit categories listed in the table of contents. Others like Bus Rapid Transit, Commuter Bus, and Streetcar Rail aren’t here.</p>

<p>The Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority operates the most reliable commuter rail. In my area, PennDoT comes in 2nd and Metro-North and LIRR rank well. NJ Transit falls exactly in the middle, 14th most reliable out of 28 reporting agencies.</p>
<p>Plotting this data clarifies things. (Reference lines are averages.) The Big 3 commuter rails–Metro-North, the Long Island Rail Road, and NJ Transit–are <em>huge</em>; among them, NJT breaks down the most often, and is less reliable than average.</p>

<li>NJT should especially compare its commuter rail to the similarly huge Metro-North and LIRR.</li>
<li>NJT commuter rail remains much less reliable than Metro-North and LIRR.</li>

<p>Note that NJ Transit has 2 records: One for its <em>Purchased Transit</em> (PT) or contracted buses, and one for its <em>Directly Operated</em> (DO) buses. While NJT’s PT buses break down less often, they also drive much less than the DO buses. (And apparently <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/transportation/2022/04/21/nj-transit-riders-coach-usa-buses-no-show/9461205002/">the PT ones sometimes don’t show up</a>.)</p>

<p>It’s not the prettiest picture, but a few things are clear. Like its commuter rail, NJ Transit’s bus system is almost peerlessly large. NJT buses break down more often than average, but do fairly well compared to similarly huge agencies, beating NYC’s MTA, LA’s Metro, Chicago’s CTA, and Philly’s SEPTA. Boston’s MBTA, though relatively smaller, does quite well.</p>

<p>We now see NJ Transit reports two light rail groups to the FTA: The Hudson-Bergen LR, which is purchased transit, and a combined record for the directly operated River Line and Newark LRs.</p>
<p>Neither of NJT’s LR groups do particularly well, and the directly operated lines are the less reliable ones.</p>
<p>I find it odd that NJ Transit runs some of the largest commuter rail and bus systems in the country, yet some of the tiniest light rails. Even combining the PT and DO vehicle/passenger car revenue miles doesn’t place them among the 10 largest. But that’s for another post.</p>

<p>WMATA is the most reliable, but PATH ranks 4th. PATCO lags behind in 10th out of 15.</p>
<p>Plotting it:</p>

<p>We see just how peerlessly massive the NYC subway is. It breaks down as often as much smaller systems, but I’m not sure this is a fair comparison. In any case, Washington state’s WMATA is great; SEPTA, San Francisco’s BART, and PATH are good; and Chicago’s CTA is bad. PATCO is hidden in the Small and Breaky cluster.</p>
<p>Zooming in on Small ones:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Now we see PATCO. For all the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5-mVy1KP70">praise PATCO rightfully gets</a> in other areas, it breaks down more often than the similarly sized Maryland TA and the bigger LA Metro.</p>

<p>Across the Delaware from PATCO, SEPTA is both much bigger and more reliable, so I believe PATCO can improve.</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>None of NJ Transit’s modes are the worst for breakdown frequency. Among their peers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>NJT commuter rail is mediocre</p></li>
<li><p>NJT buses are the best</p></li>
<li><p>NJT light rail is bad</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For heavy rail in NJ:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>PATH is good</p></li>
<li><p>PATCO is bad</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear, by “good” or “bad” I just mean “more or less [respectively] reliable than average and/or similarly sized peers.” These are my completely subjective judgements of the above rankings.</p>

<p>This post is the start of a series I’ll write on the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd">National Transit Database</a> (NTD).</p>
<p>The NTD is a series of Excel spreadsheets released annually, around early November, by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). For now, I’m interested specifically in <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/ntd-data?field_product_type_target_id=All&amp;year=all&amp;combine=breakdowns">breakdowns data</a>. In this post, I’ll describe the breakdowns data set’s structure and demonstrate how I clean it using R.</p>
<p>In later posts, I’ll use NTD data to talk about transit in the US.</p>

<p>My purposes need just certain fields and records:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Primary keys:</strong> It’s better if I demonstrate what each record represents in the next section.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>NTD ID</code>: Unique agency ID number.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Mode</code>: Transit type. Train, plane, or automobile? I only have energy to cover a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bus (MB)</p></li>
<li><p>Commuter Rail (CR)</p></li>
<li><p>Heavy Rail (HR)</p></li>
<li><p>Light Rail (LR)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>Type of Service</code>: Whether the transit was Purchased Transit (PT) (contracted out to a private firm) or Directly Operated (DO) (in-house).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Identifying info:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Agency</code>: Agency name and nickname/acronym, if it has one (e.g., Metra, WMATA).</p></li>
<li><p><code>City</code>: Agency HQ municipality.</p></li>
<li><p><code>State</code>: Agency HQ state.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Metrics:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Mean Miles Between Breakdowns</code> [calculated]: Breakdown frequency. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7BVRM%7D%7BTotal%20Mechanical%20Failures%7D"></p></li>
<li><p><code>Total Mechanical Failures</code>: Breakdowns. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%7BMajor%20Mechanical%20Failures%7D%20+%20%7BOther%20Mechanical%20Failures%7D"></p>
<ul>
<li>No <code>0</code> values, since this is the denominator in my calculated metric.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>Vehicle/Passenger Car Revenues Miles</code> (VRM): Total miles run in revenue service.</p>
<ul>
<li>No <code>0</code> values. I only want transit that actually runs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Quality flags:</strong> Indicate data that don’t meet the FTA’s quality standards. <code>"Q"</code> if data quality is questionable. <code>"W"</code> if the agency didn’t report this data to the FTA’s standards, but the FTA gave them a waiver.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Total Mechanical Failures Questionable</code></p>
<ul>
<li>No <code>"Q"</code> values.</li>

<p>Metra runs 2 Commuter Rail (CR) services, one in-house (Directly Operated [DO]) and one contracted out (Purchased Transit [PT]).</p>
<p>NJ Transit runs just 1 CR service directly, but 2 Light Rail (LR) services. The DO service is the River Line and Newark LR combined; the PT service is the Hudson-Bergen LR.</p>
<p>Hopefully this clarifies what a mode-agency-service record is.</p>
